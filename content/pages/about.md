      I've spent over ten years in tech writing and knowledge management,
      tackling everything from high-level concepts like researching best and
      worst practices to the hands-on work of proposing and building out
      knowledge bases or overhauling existing knowledge bases.


      I've spent the last six years working with KnowledgeOwl, a knowledge base
      provider. I've worn a lot of hats there, including:


      *   Providing direct customer support


      *   Reorganizing our customer knowledge base


      *   Creating, updating, and maintaining our customer knowledge base


      *   Manually testing feature releases


      *   Hosting learning sessions


      *   Writing and recording video walkthroughs of our product newsletters


      *   Demoing the software to new prospects


      *   Handling best practice calls with customers to audit their existing
      feature usage and discuss how to best configure KnowledgeOwl for their
      evolving needs


      *   Advising existing customers on getting buy-in, structuring their
      content, using metadata, and more


      *   Serving as product manager for a time


      Now I've stepped back from a lot of the hands-on day-to-day work, focusing
      mainly on maintaining the customer knowledge base and moving into some
      podcasting and other work, so I can focus more on two things I'm
      passionate about:


      *   Writing good docs


      *   Talking to others about tech writing and knowledge management


      In my non-tech life, I'm usually found outside. I hiked the entire
      Appalachian Trail in 2018, and I structure my day to hike with my dog
      Zola. I also love making things, whether it's designing and building
      furniture from scratch or baking
