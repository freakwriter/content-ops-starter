Since I've worked with KnowledgeOwl, a knowledge base provider, for nearly six years, people sometimes assume that KnowledgeOwl is the tool I'll steer them toward. Sometimes, they assume that I'll suggest KO before we've even discussed their needs and requirements.

While I'm certainly more familiar with KnowledgeOwl than any other tool, this is a totally false assumption.

Why?

There are two main reasons:

## All tools come with limitations

If you choose the tool before understanding your needs or requirements, you may adjust your needs or requirements to fit the tool, rather than choosing a tool that meets your needs and requirements.

In some cases, that mistake might not be that big of a deal. If you've naturally picked a tool that does a fairly good job of meeting most of your currently undefined requirements, it might work out okay.

But if you pick a tool that's a very poor fit? Your implementation will be a world of misery, you'll probably end up hating the tool, or worst of all, you'll give up on your knowledge base or your knowledge strategy entirely.

Every tool we use does come with some trade-offs. But I don't want you stuck with a tool that feels like all trade-offs and no benefits.

## Clarifying requirements does a lot more than you think

The second reason I don't rush to tool suggestion is that the act of defining and clarifying requirements serves so many useful purposes:

*   It establishes a common understanding of what problem(s) the tool's supposed to help you solve.

*   It forces folks to articulate assumptions they don't even know they're making about the tooling itself, the larger problem you're hoping to solve, what "solved" actually looks like, or the larger strategy this work fits into.

*   It can help us identify the nuance between absolute deal-breaking requirements, strong wants, and nice to have features.

*   It helps establish some documentation around requirements (#docsoritdidnthappen!).

*   It ensures that you're comparing apples to apples when you do consider tools.

It also should make you feel a lot more confident that you've selected the best tool for your needs.

## What this means for how we work together

Most likely, what this means is I'll ask you if you've already defined a list of requirements and, if so, if you can share them with me. Part of my role is to be sure that these requirements are well-defined, thorough, and that they map appropriately to your larger goals with implementing a knowledge base.

If you don't have requirements, we'll table any talk of specific tools or scoping/estimating that work until we can get a solid set of requirements defined and agreed upon by your team. At that point, it becomes much easier for you to evaluate tools on your own or with my help, which helps guarantee you aren't biased by my own experience so you can pick the best tool for you.
